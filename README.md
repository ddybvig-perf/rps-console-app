## Rock-Paper-Scissors
### About
This is a Maven project that I wrote in NetBeans. Everything runs from the main method. 

This was the first thing I programmed that I would call a "project." It was a great way to practice
loops and boolean operators. You get to test your skills in RPS against a random integer generator!

As you might expect, ```RockPaperScissors.java``` contains the game.
There are 3 other files bundled in with the project that were just little
exercises to get familiar with Java. There's not much to them, but feel free to check them out if you want.
